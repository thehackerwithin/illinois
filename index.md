What:
-----

A weekly meeting of researchers who are always learning new tips and tricks to
make their computational work flow more smoothly.  In these friendly sessions,
peers at all levels of experience share topics useful in our scientific
software development workflows.

This meeting would be a great venue for introducing new libraries, showing off
useful features of a scientific library or programming language you're using,
or bringing up a computational problem you're having.

Who:
----

Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to come to our meetings.

When:
-----

Every first and third Wednesday of the month: lunch - 11:30 AM, meeting - 12 PM. 

- Aug 29 -- Spring Kick-Off & Intro to Python Packaging - Mark Kamuda
- Sept 5 -- Intro to Python & Python Tips - Jon Drobny
- Sept 19 -- Intro to GitHub & Jekyll - Josh and Mark Kamuda
- Oct 3 -- Data Science & Machine learning - Cail, Cassidy, and Shubhang Goswami 
- Oct 17 -- Automated Documentation & Software Testing - Shane Keniley and Nate Walter
- Nov 7 -- Data Visualization - Mark Kamuda
- Dec 5 -- Containerization - Yubo "Paul" Yang
- Dec 19 -- Advanced Data Visualization - TBD

Where:
-------

NCSA room 2100

[1205 W Clark St, Urbana, IL][ncsa_map]

How:
-----

Participating is really easy.

* At **11:30 am**, enjoy some lunch and meet other members

* At **12:00 pm**, we gather and go through a round of introductions.
New faces are always appearing!

* Next, a volunteer will give a **tutorial** or lead a **discussion** about a
computational topic. This topic can be anything useful, new, or
interesting to scientists who compute. It may be some new skill you have recently picked
up in your research, a productivity tool you have recently learned to love, an overview of a
useful library, or anything you feel we would enjoy learning.

* Finally, there will be a time for a couple of **Lightning Talks**, which
are 5-10 minute blasts of information about a particular topic or
question of interest to the group.

**Note** that the lightning talk time is a good way to bring a
question to the group. If you have a bug you need help with, here's the
place to ask many ears about it at once.

Why:
------

The tenets of scientiﬁc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility,
comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail
to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version
control, automated documentation, and others.

To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best practices for
computational scientific applications. This group is modeled after The
Hacker Within, which  began as a student organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and
is now reborn as a collection of such chapters around the world. Each of
the chapters convenes a community of scientists, at all levels of their
education and training, to share their knowledge and best practices in
using computing to accomplish their work.
