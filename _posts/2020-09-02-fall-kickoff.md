## Fall '20 Planning

**Notes:**

- How can we use the virtual format to our advantage?
	- Code demos, collaborative hacking, etc.
- More emphasis on short talks (or just discussion topics) that don't require much preparation on the part of the speaker
- Possible "anchor" for the semester: playing with data from UIUC's [COVID-19 Testing Dashboard](https://go.illinois.edu/COVIDTestingData)
	- less involved than last semester's project,  basically a fall-back hacking project when we don't have other material to discuss
	- data is exportable, and maybe we can scrape it?
	- possible approaches: visualization, fitting, simulations
- General proposal: 1-2 discussion topics or lightning talks per meeting, then use rest of time for hacking (COVID data?).
- Switching to Zoom
