## Building a Website with Github

Creating a website is a great way to have a professional presence dedicated to you and your work. 
As a computational scientist/engineer, utilizing Github's [pages][github] free webshosting allows you to get up and runnig quickly, it helps you become more comfortable with git, connects you to your contributions to open-source projects, and your stand apart from your other colleagues.
