###"Vortex-induced Vibrations of a Sprung Cylinder with Nonlinear Internal Elements"
Antoine Blanchard

Structures immersed in a flow may experience vibrations due to their interaction with the surrounding fluid, which over time can cause fatigue or failure. We use direct numerical simulations to gain insight into the underlying dynamics of such interaction, and design novel devices that can mitigate undesired vibrations of the structure.
