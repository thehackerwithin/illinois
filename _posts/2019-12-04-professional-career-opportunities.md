For our last meeting of the semester we will hear several people with professional careers
similar to career paths our own members are interested in. We will learn about what steps
they took to get to where they are and how their education and/or research helped them
get to that stage. If you know anyone who would be interested in speaking, please email the
[Hacker Within president](mailto:cwagner4@illinois.edu).

Check back closer to the meeting date for more information!
